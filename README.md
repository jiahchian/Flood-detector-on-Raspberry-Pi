# Flood-detector-on-Raspberry-Pi
This is a Final Year Project for my degree. A combination of Ultrasonic sensor and camera that able to provide real time reading of the water level through ultrasonic sensor and able to send warning message to user's telegram with visual evidence.

#Abstract
Floods continue to affect people, even with the “infobanjir” flood detection warning system. This is because the system primarily detects floods along riverbanks. Floods can occur in residential and rural areas due to poorly designed or clogged drainage system. The current market for flood detection is only capacitive sensor, which can only detect leakage and trigger alarm. If the product alarm only happens locally, that means the user will not be notified if there’s flood in the area. It is also important to have a visual proof to the user when there’s flood to see if it’s a false alarm. This project aims to identify water levels using ultrasonic sensor and provide real-time warnings to users through IoT with visual evidence. This project will use a Raspberry Pi connected to Pi camera, powered by solar panels and lithium-ion battery. An ultrasonic sensor will be used to detect water level. User will be able to set a dangerous water level. Once the sensor detects the water level at dangerous levels or lesser, a warning message will be sent to the user’s Telegram account. This system has potential benefits for residential, rural, and business areas that are vulnerable to flooding.
